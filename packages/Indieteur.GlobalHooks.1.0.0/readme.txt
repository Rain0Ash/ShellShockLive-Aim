-------------------------------------------------

------Guide------
1. In order to use the library, you will first need to add it as a reference to your project which should automatically be done by the Nuget package manager. If it isn't, the assembly name of the library is Indieteur.GlobalHooks.
2. The namespace that contains the useable class is "Indieteur.GlobalHooks".
3. There are two instantiable class that you can use which are GlobalKeyHook and GlobalMouseHook.
4. The GlobalKeyHook handles global keyboard events while the GlobalMouseHook handles the global mouse events.
5. Both the GlobalKeyHook and the GlobalMouseHook contains events that you can subscribe to in order to receive input from either the keyboard or the mouse globally. If you want to know more about these events, you can use the Object Browser to view their summarized descriptions.

A demonstration of the library is available on https://github.com/Indieteur/GlobalHooks/tree/master/Demo
