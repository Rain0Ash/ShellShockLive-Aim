My **AIM** development for ShellShock Live. The project has a purely **educational** purpose, and I urge **NOT** to use it when playing with other players.

![Guide](https://github.com/Rain0Ash/ShellShockLive-Aim/blob/master/guide.png)

Now setting up for 1366x768 game resolution. Other screen resolutions will be available soon (given the speed of development).

***Ctrl+[Shift]+E***     Set sight to mouse position

***Ctrl+(Shift)+W|A|S|D***    Per-pixel sight offset (Shift x 10)

***Ctrl+(Shift)+Arrow Up|Down***     Power up/down (Shift x 10)

***Ctrl+(Shift)+Arrow Left|Right***     Angle left/right (Shift x 10)

***Ctrl+[Shift]+F|G|H***     Set value of wind/angle/power

***Ctrl+[Shift]+M***    Change guidance to the next mode (standart/line/+will be soon)

***Ctrl+[Shift]+Z***    Reset all

***Ctrl+[Shift]+Q***    Close



***Conceptual functions will be soon (maybe), because i have problems with creating correct math formula. If you know how to do it, please create pull request.***

If anyone want to help with portals, drawing rebound walls, black holes or something another - please send PR, because without help - development is very slow (Especially considering my knowledge of mathematics (I already figured out a bit with C#)).
